Cucumber-JVM v6.0.0
===================

TODO: Introduction.

Note: the stuff bellow includes changes from the RC candidates.

Gherkin 6+ Rule Keyword
-----------------------

Several years ago [Matt Wayne came up with example mapping][example-mapping]. An
example mapping session for a new feature produces rules and examples of these
rules. To facilitate this Gherkin now includes the rule keyword and "Example"
can now be used as an alias for "Scenario".

Message formatter to replace the Json formatter
-----------------------------------------------

With the introduction of a new keyword in Gherkin we ran into the problem that
current json formatter was essentially a direct representation of the gherkin
syntax tree; test results added to it like Christmas decorations. 

Additionally, the json formatter did not have a schema, extremely high memory
consumption, and produced different output for each Cucumber implementations. 

To resolve these issues Cucumber now has a [message based output format](cucumber-messages).
This format will eventually replace the existing json output.

To use the message formatter use:

```java
@CucumberOptions(plugin = "message:target/cucumber-report.ndjson")
```

The output looks like:

```ndjson
{"source":{"uri":"features/minimal/minimal.feature","data":"Feature: minim ...
{"gherkinDocument":{"uri":"features/minimal/minimal.feature","feature": ... 
{"pickle":{"id":"4","uri":"features/minimal/minimal.feature", ... }}
{"stepDefinition":{"id":"0","pattern":{"source":"I have {int} cukes in my ...
{"testRunStarted":{"timestamp":{"seconds":"0","nanos":0}}}
{"testCase":{"id":"6","pickleId":"4","testSteps":[{"id":"5","pickleStepId": ...
{"testCaseStarted":{"timestamp":{"seconds":"0","nanos":1000000},"attempt":0, ...
{"testStepStarted":{"timestamp":{"seconds":"0","nanos":2000000}, ...
{"testStepFinished":{"testStepResult":{"status":"PASSED","duration": ...
{"testCaseFinished":{"timestamp":{"seconds":"0","nanos":6000000}, ...
{"testRunFinished":{"timestamp":{"seconds":"0","nanos":7000000}}}
```

Improved Html Formatter
-----------------------

The old html formatter has been replaced with an improved html formatter that
outputs the entire report as single file rather than a collection of files.


```java
@CucumberOptions(plugin = "message:target/cucumber-report.html")
```

Note: If you are already using the html formatter. Do not forget to append 
`.html`.

Removed `cucumber.options`
--------------------------

The `cucumber.options` property could be used to pass commandline arguments to
cucumber. For example: 

```shell script
mvn clean test -Dcucumber.options='--strict --monochrome --tags "not @ignored"'
```

This is rather complicated. Especially so when intermediate shells also
interpret the arguments. A better way to do this is to provide each option as an
individual property.

```shell script
mvn clean test                           \ 
  -Dcucumber.strict=true                 \
  -Dcucumber.ansi-colors.disabled=true   \
  -Dcucumber.filter.tags="not @ignored"
```

A complete and accurate list of supported properties can be obtained by running

```shell script
mvn exec:java                                   \ 
  -Dexec.classpathScope=test                    \
  -Dexec.mainClass=io.cucumber.core.cli.Main    \
  -Dexec.args="--help"
```

Cucumber Spring ContextConfiguration
------------------------------------

Cucumber Spring had a complicated way to configure the application context.

The configuration could be provided by either:
 * A context configuration annotation on a class which also happens to have
   step definitions
 * A magic file named `cucumber.xml`
 * An empty application context if the previous options could not be discovered

This made it hard to explain how to use Cucumber Spring and the fallback
strategy to the empty application context hides errors.

From now on the preferred way to use `cucumber-spring` is to annotate a class
with both `@CucumberContextConfiguration` and a Spring context configuration
annotation such as `@ContextConfiguration`, `@SpringBootTest`, ect.

```java
import com.example.app;

import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;

import io.cucumber.spring.CucumberContextConfiguration;

@CucumberContextConfiguration
@SpringBootTest(classes = TestConfig.class)
public class CucumberSpringConfiguration {

}
```

The alternatives, `cucumber.xml` and annotating step definitions with a
`@ContextConfiguration` have been removed.
